Missing mandatory features :

[OK] handle strings
[OK] handle char literals
[] handle strings represented as [46,32,2]
[] handle chars represented as 째P
[] handle strings represented as [째P,째K,째b]
[OK] handle newOz atoms
[OK] handle octal/hexa numbers
[] !! operator is actually used ! see Oz doc online
[] For now we can handle functors (ozc -c MyFunctor.oz => yFunctor.ozf). How do we handle files not representing functors ?
[] make imports like :
 IMPORT VARIABLESTRICT DOT VARIABLE
 instead of record-like stuff
 No issue in parsing since we have IMPORT keyword anyway - codegen doesn't change
[] enforce atomLisp for records everywhere

Missing "nice-to-haves"

[] We need an equivalent to Scala "currying", where dots are facultative
 ex: ex1(7).ex2().browse()
[OK] The idea of a built-in function list must be complete, completely coherent, and explicit to the user.
Is it the case today ?
