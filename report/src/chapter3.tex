Conclusions que nous tirons après 1 mois de ce feedback de la communauté
Suggestions pour future work on top of this

===========================================
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Describe changes we made to the NewOz syntax.
For each :
\begin{itemize}
    \item Description of the change
    \item Motivations (previous problem, how it fixes it, philosophy of Oz) : personal opinion
    \item Implications on other existing features
    \item Implications in the compiler
    \item \textbf{Feedback from other users about this}.
    What did others think of it ? (probably =/= my opinion)
    Did we integrate their feedback ?
    If so, show intermediary steps until final version
    If not, why ?
\end{itemize}

What was user feedback in general ?
First impressions of newcomers (relevant for forging our expectations on what future students will say, for example).
Can we say this feedback met our goal described in NewOz's philsophy ?
