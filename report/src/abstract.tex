\paragraph{Abstract}
\textit{
The \textit{Oz} programming language has proven over the years its value as a learning and research tool \textcolor{red}{about} programming paradigms, in universities around the world.
It has had a major influence on the development of more recent programming languages, and has functionally stood the test of time.
That being said, its syntax lacks the ability the efficiently use some modern programming paradigms;
the goal of this work, building upon last year's thesis of Jean-Pacifique Mbonyincungu, is to design a brand new syntax for \textit{Oz}, that will allow the language to tackle new paradigms, while remaining compatible with the existing Mozart system.
