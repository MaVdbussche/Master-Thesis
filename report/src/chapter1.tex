\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the motivation behind the thesis ? (covered before)
    \item Why is it important ? (idem)
    \item What are the ambitions ? (should be covered before)
    \item What is the general philosophy ?
    Why yet anther language ?
    Why not just use Scala at this point ?

\end{itemize}

Maybe this chapter should be placed \textbf{before} the previous one, or as the beginning of it.
It feels weird to describe the goal and what has been done, and \textbf{then} the philosophy behind said work.
