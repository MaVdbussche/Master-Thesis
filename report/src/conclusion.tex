Résumé de l'approche, résumé des chapitres
How the situation of \textit{Oz} has evolved thanks to this works.\newline
What did we do well, what did we miss ? (use User feedback examples)\newline
What could future works do ? (refer to aforementioned compiler improvements, user feedback left to address)\newline

So far \textit{NewOz} focused on the subset of \textit{Oz} used at UCL and presented in~\cite{van2004concepts}.
A mature version of \textit{NewOz} should allow programmers to use the full capabilities of the \textit{Oz} language in the new syntax, which is a necessary step if \textit{NewOz} is to be included in the official release of Mozart 2.
