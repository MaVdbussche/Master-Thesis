This chapter = general community feedback - résumé des suggestions
Then we will describe what will/should change for the next version of NewOz

Conclusions que nous tirons après 1 mois de ce feedback de la communauté
Suggestions pour future work on top of this

===========================================
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Describe changes that were proposed to the NewOz syntax.
For each :
\begin{itemize}
    \item Description of the change
    \item Motivations (previous problem, how it fixes it, philosophy of Oz) : personal opinion
    \item Implications on other existing features
    \item Implications in the compiler
    \item What did others think of it ? (probably =/= my opinion)
    Did we integrate their feedback ?
    If so, show intermediary steps until final version
    If not, why ?
\end{itemize}

What was user feedback in general ?
First impressions of newcomers (relevant for forging our expectations on what future students will say, for example).
Can we say this feedback met our goal described in NewOz's philosophy ?

Donner une syntaxe finale qui comprend le feedback de la communauté
